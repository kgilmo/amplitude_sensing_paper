@article{Butt2005,
abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) is not only a tool to image the topography of solid surfaces at high resolution. It can also be used to measure force-versus-distance curves. Such curves, briefly called force curves, provide valuable information on local material properties such as elasticity, hardness, Hamaker constant, adhesion and surface charge densities. For this reason the measurement of force curves has become essential in different fields of research such as surface science, materials engineering, and biology. Another application is the analysis of surface forces per se. Some of the most fundamental questions in colloid and surface science can be addressed directly with the AFM: What are the interactions between particles in a liquid? How can a dispersion be stabilized? How do surfaces in general and particles in particular adhere to each other? Particles and surfaces interactions have major implications for friction and lubrication. Force measurements on single molecules involving the rupture of single chemical bonds and the stretching of polymer chains have almost become routine. The structure and properties of confined liquids can be addressed since force measurements provide information on the energy of a confined liquid film. After the review of Cappella [B. Cappella, G. Dietler, Surf. Sci. Rep. 34 (1999) 1-104] 6 years of intense development have occurred. In 1999, the AFM was used only by experts to do force measurements. Now, force curves are used by many AFM researchers to characterize materials and single molecules. The technique and our understanding of surface forces has reached a new level of maturity. In this review we describe the technique of AFM force measurements. Important experimental issues such as the determination of the spring constant and of the tip radius are discussed. Current state of the art in analyzing force curves obtained under different conditions is presented. Possibilities, perspectives but also open questions and limitations are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we solve the problem of nonlinear spectral analysis, required for discrete noise induced by a strongly coupled environment. Our nonperturbative analytical model shows a nonlinear signal dependence on noise power, resulting in a spectral resolution beyond the Fourier limit as well as frequency mixing. We develop a noise characterization scheme adapted to this nonlinearity. We then apply it using a single trapped ion as a sensitive probe of strong, non-Gaussian, discrete magnetic field noise. Finally, we experimentally compared the performance of equidistant vs Uhrig modulation schemes for spectral analysis.},

abstract = {The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the noise in a force measurement based on continuously detecting a mechanical oscillator's position. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can be reached when the oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment and when measurement imprecision from photon shot noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement back-action. We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically. When the driving force is resonant with the cloud's oscillation frequency, we achieve a sensitivity that is a factor of 4 above the standard quantum limit and consistent with theoretical predictions given the atoms' residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency.},

@article{Biercuk2010,
abstract = {The ability to detect extremely small forces and nanoscale displacements is vital for disciplines such as precision spin-resonance imaging, microscopy, and tests of fundamental physical phenomena. Current force-detection sensitivity limits have surpassed 1 aN Hz(-1/2) (refs 6,7) through coupling of nanomechanical resonators to a variety of physical readout systems. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of trapped atomic ions behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement detectors. We report the detection of forces with a sensitivity of 390 +/- 150 yN Hz(-1/2), which is more than three orders of magnitude better than existing reports using nanofabricated devices(7), and discriminate ion displacements of approximately 18 nm. Our technique is based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion trap and detection through phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, and should ultimately allow force detection with a sensitivity better than 1 yN Hz(-1/2) (ref. 16). Trapped-ion-based sensors could enable scientists to explore new regimes in materials science where augmented force, field and displacement sensitivity may be traded against reduced spatial resolution.},

@article{Ivanov2016a,
abstract = {We introduce quantum sensing schemes for measuring very weak forces with a single trapped ion. They use the spin-motional coupling induced by the laser-ion interaction to transfer the relevant force information to the spin-degree of freedom. Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the force with a sensitivity beyond the yN {\$}/\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} range, i.e. in the xN{\$} /\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} (xennonewton, {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-27{\}}{\$}). The Jahn-Teller protocol, in particular, can be used to implement a two-channel vector spectrum analyzer for measuring ultra-low voltages.},

@article{Britton2012,
abstract = {The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed-matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity. However, many properties of exotic, strongly correlated spin systems, such as spin liquids, have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N ≈ 30 particles. Feynman predicted that a quantum simulator--a special-purpose 'analogue' processor built using quantum bits (qubits)--would be inherently suited to solving such problems. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, but simulations allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on two- or three-dimensional lattices of more than a few tens of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, in part because of the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction, J(i,j), on a naturally occurring, two-dimensional triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-half particles (beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap). This is a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than previous experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J(i,j) proportional variant d(-a)(i,j), where 0 ≤ a ≤ 3 and d(i,j) is the distance between spin pairs. These power laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a = 0), Coulomb-like (a = 1), monopole-dipole (a = 2) and dipole-dipole (a = 3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with a theory for 0.05 ≲ a ≲ 1.4. This demonstration, coupled with the high spin count, excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap, brings within reach the simulation of otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism.},

In understanding the quantum limits of this cooling, one must consider the effect of shot noise fluctuations on the final thermal occupation. In optomechanical sideband cooling in a cavity, the finite Stokes Raman scattering defined by the cavity linewidth combined with shot noise fluctuations dictates a quantum backaction limit, analogous to the Doppler limit of atomic laser cooling. In our work we sideband cool to the quantum backaction limit by using a micromechanical membrane precooled in a dilution refrigerator. Monitoring the optical sidebands allows us to directly observe the mechanical object come to thermal equilibrium with the optical bath.},

@article{Kampel2016,
abstract = {When one seeks knowledge of the full dynamics of the displacement of a harmonic oscillator, non-commutation of the two mechanical quadratures requires a minimum added noise equal to the mechanical resonator's zero point motion. This fundamental quantum limit (QL) is a distinct bound from the standard quantum limit (SQL) that is often considered in interferometric displacement measurement. The SQL is a consequence of the non-commutation of the probe's quadratures in a specific measurement configuration and is characterized by a tradeoff between shot noise (SN) imprecision and quantum backaction that are uncorrelated. The QL and SQL reach the same limit when probing at the peak mechanical response, but the QL can be a significantly lower bound off resonance. In studies of micro-mechanical motion, there has been great interest in observing quantum backaction and approaching the SQL on mechanical resonance. However, much of what historically motivates SQL research is displacement monitoring over a wide frequency band, such as gravitational wave searches. One long-standing concept for surpassing the SQL is to introduce correlations by changing the readout quadrature as a function of frequency in a technique known as variational readout. Here we harness quantum correlations in the measurement of a macroscopic resonator by modifying the readout quadrature of an optical interferometer. By using an optomechanical device thermalized to a dilution refrigerator, we measure quantum noise far off resonance where we improve upon the off-resonance SQL for our quantum efficiency.},

abstract = {Macroscopic mechanical oscillators have been coaxed into a regime of quantum behaviour by direct refrigeration or a combination of refrigeration and laser-like cooling. This result supports the idea that mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with superconducting circuits, either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise incompatible systems. As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or a propagating mode of a microwave field to and from a storage medium has not been demonstrated, owing to the inability to turn on and off the interaction between the microwave field and the medium sufficiently quickly. Here we demonstrate that the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single-quantum level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator. In this quantum regime, the mechanical oscillator can both store quantum information and enable its transfer between otherwise incompatible systems.},

The technique is based on laser Doppler velocimetry using a cycling transition in 9Be+ near 313 nm and the center-of-mass (COM) ion motional mode. The optical dipole force is tuned to excite the COM mode, and measurements of photon arrival times synchronized with the excitation potential show oscillations with a period commensurate with the COM motional frequency. Experimental results compare well with a quantitative model for a driven harmonic oscillator. This technique permits characterization of motional modes in ion crystals; the measurement of both frequency and phase information relative to the driving force is a key enabling capability--comparable to lockin detection - providing access to a parameter that is typically not available in time-averaged measurements. This additional information facilitates discrimination of nearly degenerate motional modes.},

abstract = {In real-time quantum feedback protocols, the record of a continuous measurement is used to stabilize a desired quantum state. Recent years have seen highly successful applications in a variety of well-isolated micro-systems, including microwave photons and superconducting qubits. By contrast, the ability to stabilize the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a nanomechanical oscillator, remains a difficult challenge: The main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the state must be measured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, nanomechanical oscillator in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a critical requirement for preparing its ground state using feedback. The sensor is based on cavity optomechanical coupling, and realizes a measurement of the oscillator's displacement with an imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit, while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product within a factor of 5 of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. Using the measurement as an error signal and radiation pressure as an actuator, we demonstrate active feedback cooling (cold-damping) of the 4.3 MHz oscillator from a cryogenic bath temperature of 4.4 K to an effective value of 1.1{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.1 mK, corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.3{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.6 (i.e., a ground state probability of 16{\%}).

We show that oscillating forces that are off-resonance with the motional trap frequency can be detected very efficiently by using quantum probes represented by various spin-boson models. We demonstrate that the temporal evolution of a quantum probe described by the Dicke model can be mapped on the nonlinear Ramsey interferometry which allows to detect far-detuned forces simply by measuring the collective spin populations. Moreover, we show that the measurement uncertainty can reach the Heisenberg limit by using initial spin correlated states, instead of motional entangled states. An important advantage of the sensing technique is its natural robustness against the thermally induced dephasing, which extends the coherence time of the measurement protocol. Furthermore, we introduce sensing scheme that utilize the strong spin-phonon coupling to improve the force estimation. We show that for quantum probe represented by quantum Rabi model the force sensitivity can overcome those using simple harmonic oscillator as a force sensor.},

As these detectors progress to even better sensitivity, they will encounter measurement limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics.

Here we show a displacement measurement with an imprecision below the standard quantum limit scale. We achieve this imprecision by measuring the motion of a nanomechanical oscillator with a nearly shot-noise limited microwave interferometer. As the interferometer is naturally operated at cryogenic temperatures, the thermal motion of the oscillator is minimized, yielding an excellent force detector with a sensitivity of 0.51 aN Hz(-1/2).

abstract = {Mechanical transduction of torque has been key to probing a number of physical phenomena, such as gravity, the angular momentum of light, the Casimir effect, magnetism, and quantum oscillations. Following similar trends as mass and force sensing, mechanical torque sensitivity can be dramatically improved by scaling down the physical dimensions, and therefore moment of inertia, of a torsional spring. Yet now, through precision nanofabrication and sub-wavelength cavity optomechanics, we have reached a point where geometric optimization can only provide marginal improvements to torque sensitivity. Instead, nanoscale optomechanical measurements of torque are overwhelmingly hindered by thermal noise. Here we present cryogenic measurements of a cavity-optomechanical torsional resonator cooled in a dilution refrigerator to a temperature of 25 mK, corresponding to an average phonon occupation of {\textless}n{\textgreater} = 35, that demonstrate a record-breaking torque sensitivity of 2.9 yNm/Hz{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}. This a 270-fold improvement over previous optomechanical torque sensors and just over an order of magnitude from its standard quantum limit.

abstract = {Force sensors are at the heart of different technologies such as atomic force microscopy or inertial sensing [2, 1, 3]. These sensors often rely on the measurement of the displacement amplitude of mechan-ical oscillators under applied force. Examples for such mechanical oscillators include micro-fabricated cantilevers [3], carbon nanotubes [4] as well as single trapped ions [5, 6] . The best sensitivity is typi-cally achieved when the force is alternating at the mechanical resonance frequency of the oscillator thus increasing its response by the mechanical quality factor. The measurement of low-frequency forces, that are below resonance, is a more difficult task as the resulting oscillation amplitudes are significantly lower. Here we use a single trapped 88 Sr + ion as a force sensor. The ion is trapped in a linear harmonic trap, and is electrically driven at a frequency much lower than the trap resonance frequency. To be able to measure the small amplitude of motion we combine two powerful techniques. The force magnitude is de-termined by the measured periodic Doppler shift of an atomic optical clock transition and the Quantum Lock-in technique is used to coherently accumulate the phases acquired during different force half-cycles. We demonstrate force detection both when the oscillating force is phase-synchronized with the quantum lock-in sequence and when it is asynchronous and report frequency force detection sensitivity as low as 5.3 × 10 −19 N √ Hz . Force sensors are important for many applications ranging from computer game consoles to precision measurements of fundamental physics. Most force sensors rely on the displacement of mechanical oscillators as an estimator for the applied force. Trapped atomic ions can be well approximated as harmonic mechanical oscillators that are highly sensitive to electrical forces. Moreover, due to the extremely high quality factor of ion traps, even very small forces that are resonant with the ion-trap harmonic frequency can yield relatively large displacements. The ion displacement amplitude is usually measured through its associated Doppler shift on an optical transition [7]. Previously, ion-trap experiments have demonstrated yocto-Newton range measurement sensitivity [6, 5] of forces that were alternating at frequencies that varied between 50 − 900 kHz. Measuring forces that oscillate at frequencies much lower than this range is a challenge if one wishes to maintain the mechanical resonance condition. This is because as the trap weakens and the resonance},

abstract = {Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94{\%}. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion.},
